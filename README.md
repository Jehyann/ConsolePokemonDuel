# ConsolePokemonDuel
This transition project from C to C++ reintroduces core C language concepts while exploring their evolution in C++. 
The project involves creating a text-based turn-based combat game that fully embraces object-oriented programming, drawing inspiration from popular game series like Pokémon and Final Fantasy. 
Data from external files constructs in-game elements, allowing easy post-compilation adjustments by non-programmers. A comprehensive compendium of character creation data is also accessible. 

# Learning Objectives:
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Formats

# Project Overview:
This initial transition week from C to C++ will allow you to reacquaint yourselves with many C language concepts and syntax and witness their evolution in C++. 
The week will commence with organized exercises for familiarity, followed by dedicated time for creating a text-based turn-based combat game. 
During this project, you will fully leverage object-oriented programming to create classes, skills, and weapons, taking inspiration from popular game series like Pokémon or Final Fantasy.
The game will make use of data from data files to construct these classes and skills. These files should be modifiable after compilation, enabling a game designer to adjust combat values. 
Additionally, a compendium, a comprehensive list of all possible data for character creation in the game, will be accessible.

# Challenges:
- Understanding the evolution of C++ and its departure from C.
- Organizing character creation into a flexible object-based architecture.
- Using suitable data formats that can be modified by non-programmers to adjust game values.
- Maintaining a clear and consistent workspace.
- Handling errors arising from file reading and user choices.
